# Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
usertrap

# What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
7
This represents the system call number of `exec`

# What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
1000000000000000000000000000100010 and index 8 is set to 0
=> previous mode: user

# Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
=> num corresponds to register `a3`

# Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above?
address 0 is not mapped in the kernel address space.
Therefore, `Load Page Fault` occurred. 
This is confirmed by the value of scause, which is `0xd`

# What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
name of the process: initcode
pid: 1
