1.
a0 - a7

2.
both in the following line:
  26:	45b1                	li	a1,12 # a1 <- 12 : f(8) + 1 => g(8) + 1 => 8 + 3 + 1

3.
0x6cc

4.
0x34
=>
for "jal" instruction, the instruction address following the jump instruction is recorded in the register "ra".
the next instruction to be executed after "printf" returns is 0x34

5.
output?
=> "HE110 World"
if RISC-V was big endian, what should be the value of "i" to print the same output?
=> 0x726c6400
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
=> No.

6.
Answer
=> the value which was stored in the register a2.
Why?
=> calling convention of RISC-V.
a0: format string / a1: first arg (=3) / a2: second arg
